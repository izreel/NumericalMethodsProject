This code computes the explicit integration of a function over some interval [a,b].
Any function the user inputs must contain at most one variable.
Example: x is allowed but x + y is not.
This program requires the user input some function. The input must be written in such a way that meets python syntax.However, we made
parser to convert ^ to ** to match python syntax.

All of the trigonometry functions and certain constants come from Numpy library.
Most trigonometry functions are supported with the exceptions of cosecant, cotangent and secant. User must convert them to their counterparts.
Pi can also be used by typing pi.
e can also be used by typing e.
Logarithm functions with base e can also be used with log()
